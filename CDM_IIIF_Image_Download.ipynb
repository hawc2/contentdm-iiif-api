The fund was created to raise money for food, clothing, and medical aid for Belgian citizens and soldiers trapped behind the firing lines, and the founders hoped to deliver these supplies via the Belgian canal network.

During World War I, the statue was hit by a German artillery shell, and, as depicted in the poster, it remained nearly horizontal to the ground for most of the war.  Superstitions arose amongst soldiers of both sides regarding the meaning of the statue's bend and the effects that toppling the statue would have on the outcome of the war.  British troops, fearing that the Germany army would use the basilica's tower as an artillery post, shelled and destroyed the structure in April 1918.  The mystical statue was forever lost once the tower collapsed, and after the war, a replica was produced to sit atop the rebuilt basilica, which also serves as World War I museum today.\",\n\"Signed: J.
